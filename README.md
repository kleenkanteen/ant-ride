## Purpose
Minimize the effort needed to organize carpools. An organizer
can create an event, then share it with a simple link. Participants
can enter their name and location and whether they can drive. 24 hours
before the event starts, everyone gets a text message of their assigned
driver. The groups are auto created as well as made to minimize total 
distance travelled. No such website exists as of now.

When I shared this idea with a researcher who worked at a hospital.
He said that in 2018, workers of GO trains striked which many of 
his fellow hospital workers rode. On the internal message boards, 
people tried coordinating carpools. I can only assume it was tedious 
messaging people back and forth, finding out how far they lived near each other.

Team of 3. I (Sabih) had the idea and invited my 2 teammates. I'm fighting climate change one line at a time.
