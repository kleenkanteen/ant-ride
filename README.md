## Purpose
Minimize the effort needed to organize carpools. An organizer
can create an event, then share it with a simple link. Participants
can enter their name and location and whether they can drive. 24 hours
before the event starts, everyone gets a text message of their assigned
driver. The groups are auto created as well as made to minimize total 
distance travelled. No such website exists as of now.

Team of 3. I (Sabih) had the idea and invited my 2 teammates. I'm fighting climate change one line at a time.
