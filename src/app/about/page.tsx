        Ant ride is a carpooling website to make it as easy and efficient as
        possible to organize carpools. What makes it different from existing
        websites is that it automatches all participants into carpools 24 hours
        before the event start. This eliminates the coordination usually needed
        where everyone has to choose a car to ride in. It also allows the
        creation of the most optimal carpool routes based on everyoneâ€™s
        location.
